Before posting you might want to read the [Tips for getting help](tips-for-getting-help).

Many users prefer to use online forums rather than joining a mail list which can lead to lots more email traffic so we use the online forums at [Nabble forums](http://activemq.2283324.n4.nabble.com/) which also work with our [Mailing Lists](mailing-lists) so that both stay completely in sync. Use either the mailing lists or online forums, its completely up to you.

### [ActiveMQ Forums](http://activemq.2283324.n4.nabble.com/)

*   [ActiveMQ User Forum](http://activemq.2283324.n4.nabble.com/ActiveMQ-User-f2341805.html)
*   [ActiveMQ Developer Forum](http://activemq.2283324.n4.nabble.com/ActiveMQ-Dev-f2368404.html)

### Mailing Lists

If you prefer to use a mailing list instead then check out our [Mailing Lists](mailing-lists). Note that the Forums and [Mailing Lists](mailing-lists) are kept in sync so its your choice which you use.
