        <ul>
          <li>A JIRA clean-up closed stale tickets, resulting in about 1/2 as many open</li>
          <li>ActiveMQ 5.16.4 released, this is a maintenance release; fixing
              issue and switching to reload4j instead of log4j1 fixing several
              security issues.</li>
          <li>ActiveMQ 5.17.0 released, this is a major release in the
              ActiveMQ "classic" roadmap. It brings JDK11 support, Spring 5
              upgrade (Spring 4 is now deprecated), Log4j2 update (instead of
              log4j1 in previous releases), and bunch of other
              improvements.</li>
          <li>ActiveMQ 5.18.0 development planning has started. The work we
              started around JMS 2 support has been postponed to ActiveMQ
              5.18.0 in order to give us time to clean tests and review.</li>
