Apache ActiveMQ ™ -- QoS 

 [FAQ](/FAQ/index.md) > [Terminology](../../FAQ/terminology.md) > [QoS](../../FAQ/Terminology/qos.md)


QoS is a MOM abbreviation of the term _Quality of Service_. There are many different kinds of messaging with different qualities of service such as

*   topics versus queues
*   durable messaging versus _reliable_ (some buffering takes place but if a consumer is down long enough the messages are discarded)
*   message timeout

etc.
